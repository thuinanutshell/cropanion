# CROPANION - Tree Hacks 2022

*We leverage the power of Machine Learning as precision agriculture in intercropping farming to tackle climate change and promote sustainability in vulnerable regions around the world.*

After conducting much research, we saw crop diversification via intercropping (growing more than one crop on the same land) or crop rotation (growing multiple crops at different times) is one of the solutions to increase the resilience and sustainability of farming. Also, many African and South(east) Asian countries are agriculture-based economies, but they have been feeling the impacts of climate change for years. As a result, to help these disadvantaged communities overcome this crisis, we believe that the key is to create biodiverse agriculture that mimics nature well.

To introduce a new crop, we need to consider many variables, one of which is the environmental compatibility of the crop and the area. We applied supervised Machine Learning and OpenAI API to build this product.
